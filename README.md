# Tank battle
Welcome to my tank battle game prototype, developed in Java using the Processing library and Gradle as a dependency manager.

## Overview
 In this game, players control tanks, strategically aiming and firing to score hits and reduce opponents' health. 
 The player with the highest score after all levels wins. This project demonstrates my skills in game development and Java programming, turning a concept into a playable, dynamic experience.
 
## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/pragonp/Tank-Battle.git
cd Tank-Battle
```
2. Run the game
```
gradle run
```
   

## Features
- **Tank Movement:** Players can navigate their tanks around the battlefield.-Aiming and Firing: Players can aim their tank's turret and fire at opponents.
- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of each player's score throughout the levels.
- **Health Management:** Tanks have a health system that decreases upon being hit.

## Tool and Technologies
- **Java:** The game logic is implemented in Java with OOP principles
- **Processing Libaries:** Used for rendering the game's graphics.
- **Gradle:** Employed as a dependency manager to handle library dependencies and build configurations.

## Future Enhancement
- Adding AI-controlled tanks with several difficulties
- Adding more powerups
